Summary:

## Motivation

As we all know, amplitude based imaging methods are the most common method for ultrasonic testing. Defects always lead to extra echo and always affects the amplitude of backwall echo.
Envelope detection technology can be used to extract the amplitude in ultrasonic imaging. So we made this plugin to detect the envelope of the waveform.
