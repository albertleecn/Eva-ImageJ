EVA stand for "EVAluation", it also comes from the movie "WALL-E" by Disney, in wihich Walle called the other robot Eva, a "Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator".

EVA project aims to build open source platform and community for imaging and evaluation research in life science, medcine and material science.
Currently, the main program is based on Icy from Institut Pasteur. One of our effort is to extend the usage of Icy from Bioimaging to medicine and NDE to support methods such as Ultrasonic Imaging, Radiography, etc., this will achieved mainly based on the plugin mechanism of Icy. Hardware can be connected to the platform through Micro-manager, not only microscopies but also other data acquisition devices or imaging device can be included. Meanwhile we also hope to cover some open source hardware to build low-cost research purpose imaging platform. In terms of evaluation, we planning to integrate machine learning and some other state-of-the-art algorithms to achieve the goal.
