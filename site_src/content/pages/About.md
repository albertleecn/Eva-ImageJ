EVA stands for "evaluation", it also comes from the movie "WALL-E" by Disney, in wihich Walle called the other robot Eva, a "Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator".

EVA project aims to build an open source platform and community for imaging and evaluation in material science and medical science.

Currently, the main program is based on Icy from Institut Pasteur. One of our effort is to extend the usage of Icy from bioimaging to medical science and material science, to support inspection methods such as Ultrasonic Imaging and Radiography, etc., this will be achieved mainly based on the plugin mechanism. 

Hardware can be connected to the platform through Micro-manager, not only microscopies but also other data acquisition devices or imaging device can be included. Meanwhile we also hope to cover some open source hardware to build low-cost imaging platform for research purpose. 

In terms of evaluation, we planning to integrate machine learning and some other state-of-the-art algorithms to gain better result.
